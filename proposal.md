# Junebug by UWIT - Automated Device Status Detection
## Introducing Junebug ##
&emsp;&emsp;Junebug has been created to round out the service capabilities of the UWIT CTS team. We currently have hardware installed in hundreds of rooms on campus. In order to maintain this equipment, technicians are assigned a portion of campus to preform routine preventative maintenance checks. This constant rotation of manual checks has allowed our team to find and remedy issues *before* a lecturer has to report it, but the time, staffing, and documentation requirements are a significant limitation on our capabilities.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;To alleviate this demand, resources have been built to automatically send out ICMP echoes to check for device activity on our Audio/Visual vLAN. While this allows for a quick scan at the Network layer, but is prone to false negatives and isn't very informative. Expanding on this, Junebug leverages LLDP advertisements on local room switches to analyze device statuses for critical infrastructure and local network devices. Upon collecting this information, the resulting data is used to detect if a device has fallen offline, set alert statuses if needed, and update device uptime.

## Accessing Junebug ##
&emsp;&emsp;This tool has been designed as a RESTful API living within the Data Center's VM. To retrieve processed room status data, Junebug includes queries to filter JSON data by priority, lifetime, and room. This API is Pythonic for ease of reading and portability, and uses separate thread pools to manage incoming HTTP requests and data collection seamlessly. This JSON data is intended to be accessed by other CTS tools. In order to collect this data, C has been chosen for its ability to open and maintain processes and its universal nature. 

## Resource Requirements ##
&emsp;&emsp;To access local LLDP information, ssh was deemed the most effective manner of interfacing with room switches remotely (a capability that would need afforded to the VM that Junebug lives within). This ability is currently unavailable to the CTS team as a whole, and would likely need extended to a testing environment before launching to a VM as well. Along with that, authorization to read LLDP records is crucial, but currently only available on Juniper-branded switches using CTS credentials. This increased accessibility, while unprecedented within the CTS team, will allow for service capabilities that are necessary to preserve the team's bandwidth as our responsibilities continue to grow.

## Security Considerations ##
&emsp;&emsp;One of the great advantages to launching this project as a VM is HTTP requests are managed by the data center. Since these requests aren't meant to be accessed via browser, additional header verification is used to confirm that the value of the Authorization header is a registered user internally. Similarly, using ssh v2 allows this tool to leverage the security measures already deployed across campus. A scenario has been produced experimentally where a Netgear switch will ask for a password after the user is already logged in. In the event that this happens, a local and encrypted file will house the necessary verification, and a process will be instantiated to retrieve that password to send to the existing ssh process. For servicing capabilities, Junebug's API will also be able to handle requests from authorized users to configure relevant variables like the frequency at which rooms are checked and whitelisting certain anomalies to prevent false status alerts. These requests will be managed much like any GET request, but a separate Authorization header will be used.
&emsp;&emsp;Along with ensuring data is handled and communicated securely, measures have been taken to create secure code.
